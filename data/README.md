# Dataset Description for Diabetes Prediction Models

## Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It is widely used for binary classification tasks related to diabetes prediction.

## Format
The dataset is in CSV format and consists of several columns representing various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

### Columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating the absence or presence of diabetes

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset are replaced with the mean or median of the respective columns.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Features are scaled using standardization or normalization techniques to ensure that they contribute equally to the model training.
3. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

## Usage
This dataset can be loaded using pandas in Python, and it is recommended to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) before training the models to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
